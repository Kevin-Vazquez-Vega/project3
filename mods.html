      <h1>My Favorite Terraria Content Mods</h1>

      <h2>What is Terraria?</h2>
      <p>Terraria is a 2D sandbox action-adventure game made by Re-logic, revolving around exploration, survival, crafting, combat, mining, etc.</p>
	  <p>Terraria is noted to be similar to Super Metroid and Minecraft in terms of exploration and adventure.</p>
	  <p>The game was first published in May of 2011, and since then, it has been posted to numerous platforms and is still receiving updates.</p>
      <p>I have played this game for almost a decade. A couple of years ago, I went to look at mods that added new content as if it was free downloadable content since I've already played the base game a lot.</p>
	  <p>I found a couple that I really loved, and that I still keep playing to this day; Here they are.</p>

          <img class="calamity-img" src="media/calamity.png" alt="Calamity Mod">
	      <h2>The Calamity Mod</h2>
          <p>Currently the most downloaded mod in the tModLoader workshop in Steam, and for good reason as well.</p>
          <p>The mod adds more hours into a game, which already takes a ton of hours to beat, and includes content and game progression even after beating the base game's final boss.</p>
          <p>Calamity adds tons of new bosses, biomes, thousands of items, NPCs, and even harder difficulty options.</p>
          <p>Calamity also has a pretty cool soundtrack, with the head composer being DM Dokuro. One of my favorite soundtracks, the title theme, is playing in the background of this website.</p>
          <p>This is the mod I play the most; it has some heavy replay-value, so much so that whenever a new update for this mod comes out, I start a new playthrough.</p>

          <img class="thorium-img" src="media/thorium.png" alt="Thorium Mod">
          <h2>Thorium Mod</h2>
          <p>Thorium feels as if the developers of Terraria itself made an update to the game.</p>
          <p>Along with adding more hours of content, more bosses, even more items than Calamity, and some NPCs, there are also 3 new classes added in this mod.</p> 
          <p>There is the Bard, which is a music based class, the healer, which can even revive other players from death, and the throwing class, a class based on a removed subclass from the base game.</p>

        <div class="slide">
		<div class="numbers">3/3</div>
          <img class="fargo-img" src="media/fargos.png" alt="Fargo's Soul Mod">
          <h2>Fargo's Soul Mod</h2>
          <p>Take Terraria and turn it into Dark Souls, along with adding an unnecessarily large crafting tree.</p>   
          <p>Fargo's Soul Mod's primary features include adding a difficulty mode which almost completely changes the way enemies and bosses work, and with that, it also adds numerous crafting recipes which all build up to a single, powerful accessory at the end of the game.</p>
          <p>I remember the first time playing this mod not knowing that even the most seasoned of players can struggle against something new. I even had to completely change playstyles when approaching bosses or certain enemies.</p>
		</div>
        <p>Despite its difficulty, I find this mod really fun once one gets used to how it works.</p>

      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>
      <p>I have played all of these mods twice or thrice now, with Calamity being the most repeatedly played mod by me. I do not even know how many times I have replayed that mod.</p>
      <p>I hope that, if you have Terraria, and if you have enough experience in that game, that you try out these mods, though I do not recommend trying out Fargo's Soul Mod first.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
